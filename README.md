# rmo
An R package for the *Marshall-Olkin distribution*: algorithms for the construction, simulation and estimation.

## Motivation

While the academic literature on the Marshall-Olkin distributions is extensive, an intuitive and easy to use implentation is still missing. This project aims to provide an `R` package makes it simple and fun to use Marshall-Olkin distributions for research and real-world applications.


## Recent news

- Sep. 28, 2019: I initialized this project today. As of now, there is no code in the repository. The next goal is to provide the necessary background documentation on the Marshall-Olkin distribution and outline a project plan. Stay tuned.
