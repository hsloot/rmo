The [Marshallâ€“Olkin distribution](The-Marshall-Olkin-distribution.html) is a
multivariate distribution which is for dimension \( d \) parametrized by
\( 2^{d} - 1 \) non-negative parameters for each non-empty subset
\( \emptyset \neq I \subseteq {\{ 1 , \ldots, d\}} \).
To represent such a distribution in a computer program, we need an efficient
way to represent all \( 2^{d} - 1 \) parameters.
The current best-practice, see [@Mai2017a, p. 109], is to identify all
\( 2^{d} - 1 \) non-empty subsets with a natural number in
\( 1, \ldots , 2^{d} - 1 \) via a binary representation.


## The binary representation

Each natural (non-zero) number \( j \) can be represented by a 0-1-sequence
\( c = {\{ c_{k} \}}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \in {\{ 0, 1 \}}^\mathbb{N} \) with

\[
    j
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
            c_{k} 2^{k}
        } ,
\]

where \( 2^{0} = 1 \) and all but finitely many \( c_{k} \) are zero.

__Proof:__
The statement is true for \( j = 1 \) with
\( c_{0} = 1 \) and \( c_{k} = 0,\ k > 0 \).
This representation is also unique.
Assume now that the statement is true for all natural numbers
smaller than \( j \).
If \( j \) is divisible by \( 2 \), then there exists by induction assumption a
sequence \( \tilde{c} = {\{ \tilde{c}_{k} \}}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \)
for \( j / 2 \) with

\[
    j / 2
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
            \tilde{c}_{k} 2^{k}
        } .
\]

Consequently,

\[
    j
        = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{
            \tilde{c}_{k-1} 2^{k}
        }
\]

and we can choose \( c_{0} = 0 \) and \( c_{k} = \tilde{c}_{k-1},\ k > 0 \).
If \( j \) is not divisible by \( 2 \), then \( j-1 \) is and there exists by
induction assumption a sequence
\( \tilde{c} = {\{ \tilde{c}_{k} \}}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \) for \( (j-1)/2 \)
with

\[
    (j-1)/2
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
            \tilde{c}_{k} 2^{k}
        } .
\]

Consequently,

\[
    j
        = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{
                \tilde{c}_{k-1} 2^{k}
            }
\]

and we can choose \( c_{0} = 1 \) and \( c_{k} = \tilde{c}_{k-1},\ k > 0 \).
Since each summand with a positive \( c_{k} \) contributes an amount bigger or
equal to \( 1 \) to the sum, it is clear that all but finitely many \( c_{k} \)
must be equal to zero.


## Uniqueness of the binary representation

It can be proven by induction that the binary representation is unique.
To see this, consider two sequences
\( \hat{c} = {\{ \hat{c}_{k} \}}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \),
\( c = {\{ c_{k} \}}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \in {\{ 0 , 1 \}}^\mathbb{N} \)
with

\[
    \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_{k} 2^{k}
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \hat{c}_{k} 2^{k} .
\]

It is easy to see, that this number is even if and only if \( c_{0} = 0 \) and
odd if and only if \( c_{0} = 1 \).
Hence, we can w.l.o.g. assume that \( c_{0} = \hat{c}_{0} = 0 \), i.e., the
number is even.
By dividing both sides by two, we obtain

\[
    \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
            c_{k+1} 2^{k}
        }
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
                \hat{c}_{k+1} 2^{k}
            } .
\]

With the induction assumption, we get the claim.


## Integer division

Integer division is defined as follows

\[
  / : \mathbb{N}_{0}^{2} \to \mathbb{N}_{0}, {(k, n)}
    \mapsto \sup{\{ j \in \mathbb{N}_{0} \ :\ j\cdot k \leq n  \}} .
\]

For \( n = 2 \) an equivalent definition is

\[
    k / 2
        = \begin{cases}
            i               &       k = i \cdot 2,\ k\ \text{even or}\ k=0 , \\
            (k-1)/2         &       k\ \text{odd} .
        \end{cases}
\]

If we define

\[
    2^{n}
        = \underbrace{ 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 }_{n\ \text{times}} ,
\]

we can easily see that

\[
    j / 2^{n}
        = j \underbrace{/ 2 / \ldots / 2}_{n\ \text{times}} .
\]

This means

\[
    j / 2^{n}
        = {\left(
                \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
                    c_{k} 2^{k}
                }
            \right)} / 2^n
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
                c_{n+k} 2^{k}
            } .
\]

Consequently, we have

\[
    c_{n}
        = {( j / 2^{n} )} \ \mathrm{mod}\ 2 .
\]



## Iterating through binary representations

A natural question is, if we can easily determine the binary representation of
\( j+1 \) directly from the binary representation of \( j \).

Consider a natural number with its binary representation

\[
    j
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
                c_{k} 2^{k}
            }
\]

and let

\[
    k^{\ast}
        = \min{\{ i \ :\ c_{i} = 0 \}} .
\]

Then (by the geometric sum formula)

\[
    1
        = 2^{k^{\ast}} - {\left( 2^{k^{\ast}} - 1 \right)}
        = 2^{k^{\ast}} - \sum_{i=0}^{k^{\ast} - 1}{ 2^{i} } .
\]

Hence, with

\[
    \tilde{c}_k
        = \begin{cases}
            0       & k < k^{\ast} , \\
            1       & k = k^{\ast} , \\
            c_{k}   & k > k^{\ast} ,
    \end{cases}
\]

we have

\[
    j+1
        = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{
                \tilde{c}_{k} 2^{k}
            } .
\]


## The MO parameter mapping

We choose the following bijections to store all Marshall-Olkin parameters in a
vector of length \( 2^{d} - 1 \):

\[
    T 
        : \mathcal{P}{({\{ 1 , \ldots, d \}} \setminus \emptyset)}
            \to \{ 1 , \ldots, 2^{d} - 1 \},
        \ I \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{d}{
            1_{\{ i \in I \}} 2^{i-1}
        } .
\]

\[
    T^{-1}
        : {\{ 1 , \ldots, 2^{d} - 1 \}}
            \to \mathcal{P}{({\{ 1 , \ldots, d\}} \setminus \emptyset)},
        \ j \mapsto {\{ i \ :\ (j / 2^{i-1}) \ \mathrm{mod}\ 2 = 1 \}} .
\]
