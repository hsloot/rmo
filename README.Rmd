An R package for the *Marshall-Olkin distribution*: algorithms for the construction, simulation and estimation.

## Motivation

While the academic literature on the Marshall-Olkin distributions is extensive,
an intuitive and easy to use implementation is still missing. This project aims
to provide an `R` package makes it simple and fun to use Marshall-Olkin
distributions for research and real-world applications.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hsloot/rmo")
```

## Example

```{r, include=TRUE}
# library(rmo)
rmo_esm(n=10L, d=2L, intensities=c(1, 1, 1))
```


## Roadmap for future development

We are planning to develop the package incrementally. The packages API might
change frequently without deprecation. The goal is to implement prototypes of
the algorithms in `R` and refactor them in compiled code afterwards. The
original `R` implementations are supposed to serve as test functions in the
unit-test harness. 

As of now, we have completed the reimplementation of all sampling algorithms 
in `Rcpp`. Our next steps are:

- __Version 0.3__: Refactor and document test and write new test cases to 
  increase the coverage. Provide non trivial exchangeable and 
  non-exchangeable parametrisations for testing.

Other ideas for the future:

- Implementation of estimation routines (__help wanted__).
- An *OOP* implementation of the Marshall--Olkin distribution with the ultimate
  goal to facilitate a hierarchical construction of Marshall--Olkin
  distributions.
